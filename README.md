3. Run the project: npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000


### Features
The DSA Visualizer project includes the following features:

## Sorting Algorithms: Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quicksort, and Mergesort.
## Graph Algorithms: Create and visualize graphs, and apply algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Minimum Cost Path, and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
## Tree Algorithms: Visualize and understand tree traversal techniques like PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder traversal.
## Equation Solver Algorithms: Solve input equations using various techniques.
## N-Queens Problem: Visualize all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.
## Minesweeper Game: Play Minesweeper by flagging squares and avoiding mines.
## Game2048: Slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and reach the tile numbered 2048.

### Usage
Select the algorithm you wish to visualize from the navigation bar.
Follow the instructions to input data or use preset inputs.
Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.
Pause, play, or reset the animation as needed.
This project is a great resource for students and developers learning data structures and algorithms.
